Lesson 24
-Server can store state and do work(perform computations)
-Processes are concurrent and run in parallel but message handling is serialized in server process(synchronization point)
    -We don't want multiple processes trying to update cache at the same time
Agents
-Agent is a quick and easy way to store state in a process(only thing it can do)
{:ok, agent} = Agent.start(fn -> [] end)
Agent.update(agent, fn(state) -> [{"larry, 10} | state] end)
Agent.get(agent, fn(state) -> state end)
